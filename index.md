Updated the gant chart for our project. Currently on track and finished the requirement writeup before expected, so has been adjused in the chart. Everthing has been shuffled a bit so it can be fitted in before our deadline on the 2nd of Feb. Hopefully we can complete the implementation quicker than expected to allow us more time on the other deliverables.
