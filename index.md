Our current plan for the overview of our project. Currently on track but may take us longer than expected to finish the requirement elicitation. The Gant chart is likely to drastically change in the next meeting.  

## Week Beginning 29th November 2021

Updated the Gant chart for our project. Currently on track and finished the requirement writeup before expected, so has been adjusted in the chart. Everything has been shuffled a bit so it can be fitted in before our deadline on the 2nd of Feb. Hopefully we can complete the implementation quicker than expected to allow us more time on the other deliverables.

## Week Beginning 17th January 2022
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ENG1-GROUP18/ENG1-GROUP18.io/main/assets/17-1-2022_GantChart.svg">
Updated the Gant chart for our project following group meeting. Currently on track to finish the write up before the due date, the times have been adjusted to reflect this. The implementation was not finished by the date previously mentioned, an extra block of implementation has been added to reflect this. This plan should stay the same but is subject to change.
